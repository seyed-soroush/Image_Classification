üéØ Project Overview
This project tackles the problem of image classification using the well-known CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes such as airplane, automobile, bird, cat, dog, and others.
The objective is to design and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can accurately classify these images, while applying various optimization techniques to improve model performance.

üìö Technologies and Tools
Python (with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

TensorFlow / Keras

Matplotlib for data visualization

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
